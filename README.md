# Predictive-Maintenance-using-DRL

Predictive Maintenance using Deep Reinforcement Learning is an approach that uses reinforcement learning and deep learning concepts to learn an optimal policy for machines to undergo prediction based on the sensor data from the machine.
Reinforcement Learning is good at learning using trial and error method while Deep Learning is good at remembering and generalizing patterns from large datasets.
CNN and RNN are used to compare their performance working with the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.
